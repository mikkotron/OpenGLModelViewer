This project is heavily based on a OpenGL Course - Create 3D and 2D Graphics With C++ tutorial provided by freeCodeCamp.org that can be found in youtube. I started it so I could learn Open GL. Right now you can draw do 3d models through 
code adjusting the vertex positions and you can upload image textures for them through code. It is a very simple 3D model viewer with simple camera controls.
